# Intro to Ajax

Ajax allows clients (browsers) to request and load data asynchronously, in fact, AJAX stands for:
```
Asynchronous
JavaScript
And
XML
```
request.

Ajax requests allow for content retrieval and rendering without reloading the webpage.
The Asynchronous bit of the acronym means that the request doesn't block other events from happening.
